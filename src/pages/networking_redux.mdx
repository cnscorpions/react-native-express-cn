By default, Redux only handles synchronous actions. However, there are some great middlewares (plugins) for handling asynchronous actions.

For small to medium apps, the [redux-thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk) middleware is extremely effective. It's also created by the author of redux, so it's pretty much guaranteed to be high-quality and up-to-date.

For large apps with very complex asynchronous chains of events, you may want to consider [redux-saga](https://github.com/yelouafi/redux-saga), which is an extremely powerful but mind-bendingly complex framework for managing flow control. You can think of sagas as background daemon processes, which you can fork and join, maintaining complete control over the asynchronous events in your app. These are also great for testability.

# Posts Example

Let's look at `redux-thunk` in action. We'll automatically fetch posts when the app starts, and provide a button to refresh them.

Thanks to Redux Thunk, we can now dispatch functions. When we dispatch a function, we must return a function that takes `(dispatch, getState)` as props. Using `dispatch`, our function can dispatch other actions. We can also view the current state of the store by calling `getState()`.

## Files

- `index.js`<br />

    这个文件中创建redux store并将其传递给我们的`Provider`。它还将 "thunk "中间件应用到store，以处理异步操作。

- `postsRedux.js`<br />

    这包含了用于获取帖子和更新store的actionCreators和reducer。

- `App.js`<br />

    `App`使用`connect()`连接到store。它从redux商店中提取帖子数据，以及加载和错误的状态。
